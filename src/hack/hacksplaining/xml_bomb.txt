XML Bombs are an easy way for an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack against your server,
if it accepts XML uploads.


A malicious XML file could take your server offline, causing the loss of critical functions and the loss of revenue.
Protecting yourself is a matter of making sure your XML parser is properly configured.

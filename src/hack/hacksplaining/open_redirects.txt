Disallow Offsite Redirects

You can prevent redirects to other domains by checking the URL being passed to the redirect function. Make sure all redirect URLs are relative paths – i.e. they start with a single / character. (Note that URLs starting with // will be interpreted by the browser as a protocol agnostic, absolute URL – so they should be rejected too.)

If you do need to perform external redirects, consider whitelisting the individual sites that you permit redirects to.

Check the Referrer When Doing Redirects

Redirects to URLs passed in query parameters should only be triggered by pages on your site. Any other sites triggering a redirect should be treated with extreme suspicion. As a second layer of defense, check that the Referer in the HTTP request matches your domain whenever you perform a redirect.



import re

def is_relative(url):
  return re.match(r"^\/[^\/\\]", url)

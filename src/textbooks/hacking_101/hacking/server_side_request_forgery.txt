Server side request forgery, or SSRF, is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to use a
target server to make HTTP requests on the attacker’s behalf. This is similar to CSRF in
that both vulnerabilities perform HTTP requests without the victim recognizing it. With
SSRF, the victim would be the vulnerable server, with CSRF, it would be a user’s browser.

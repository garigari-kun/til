Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) Injection is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a

user manages to insert a CRLF into an application. The CRLF characters represent an end

of line for many internet protocols, including HTML, and are %0D%0A which decoded

represent \r\n. These can be used to denote line breaks and when combined with HTTP

Request / Response Headers, can lead to different vulnerabilities, including HTTP Request

Smuggling and HTTP Response Splitting.

In terms of HTTP Request Smuggling, this usually occurs when an HTTP request is passed

through a server which processes it and passes it to another server, like a proxy or

firewall. This type of vulnerability can result in:

• Cache poisoning, a situation where an attacker can change entries in the cache and

serves malicious pages (e.g., containing javascript) instead of the proper page

• Firewall evasion, a situation where a request can be crafted to avoid security checks,

typically involving CRLF and overly large request bodies

• Request Hijacking, a situation where an attacker can steal HttpOnly cookies and

HTTP authentication information. This is similar to XSS but requires no interaction

between the attacker and client

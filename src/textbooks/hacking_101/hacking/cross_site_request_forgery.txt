A Cross-Site Request Forgery, or CSRF, attack occurs when a malicious website, email,

instant message, application, etc. causes a user’s web browser to perform some action

on another website where that user is already authenticated, or logged in. Often this

occurs without the user knowing the action has occurred.

The impact of a CSRF attack depends on the website which is receiving the action. Here’s

an example:

1. Bob logs into his bank account, performs some banking but does not log out.

2. Bob checks his email and clicks a link to an unfamiliar website.

3. The unfamiliar website makes a request to Bob’s banking website to transfer money

passing in cookie information stored from Bob’s banking session in step 1.

4. Bob’s banking website receives the request from the unfamiliar (malicious) website,

without using a CSRF token and processes the transfer.

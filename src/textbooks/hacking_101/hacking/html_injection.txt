Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) injection is also sometimes referred to as virtual

defacement. This is really an attack made possible by a site allowing a malicious user

to inject HTML into its web page(s) by not handling that userâ€™s input properly. In other

words, an HTML injection vulnerability is caused by receiving HTML, typically via some

form input, which is then rendered as is on the page. This is separate and distinct from

injecting Javascript, VBscript etc.

Since HTML is the language used to define the structure of a web page, if an attacker

can inject HTML, they can essentially change what a browser renders. Sometimes this

could result in completely changing the look of a page or in other cases, creating forms

to trick users. For example, if you could inject HTML, you might be able to add a <form> tag

to the page, asking the user to re-enter their username and password. However, when

submitting this form, it actually sends the information to an attacker.

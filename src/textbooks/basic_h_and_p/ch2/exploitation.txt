- Exploitation

In the simplest terms, exploitation is the process of gaining control over a
system. However, it is important to understand that not every exploit leads to
total system compromise. For example, the Oracle padding exploit can reveal
information and allow us to download files but does not fully compromise
the system. More accurately defined, an exploit is a way to bypass a security flaw
or circumvent security controls. This process can take many different forms but
for the purpose of this book, the end goal always remains the same:
administrative-level access to the computer. In many ways, exploitation is an
attempt to turn the target machine into a puppet that will execute your com-
mands and do your bidding. Just to be clear, exploitation is the process of
launching an exploit. An exploit is the realization, actualization, or weaponiza-
tion of vulnerability. Exploits are issues or bugs in the software code that give
a hacker or attacker the ability to launch or execute a payload against the target
system. A payload is a way to turn the target machine into a puppet and force it to
do our will. Payloads can alter the original functionality of the software and allow
us to do any number of things like install new software, disable running services,
add new users, open backdoors to the compromised system, and much more.


- Medusa: Gaining access to remote services
Another software to hack a password would be Hydra

Kali linux has password dictionary data located at
/usr/share/wordlists


What I need is
target IP
some remote authentication service
password dict
username list

I can use Medusa for cracking a password.
The command will be


medusa -h <target_ip> -u <username> -P <path_to_password_dict> -M <authentication_service_to_attack>

or If I have a list of users
medusa -h <target_ip> -U <username_list> -P <path_to_password_dict> -M <authentication_service_to_attack>



Expected attack plan:
example.com is the host that I'll be attacking.
In the information gathering process, I found the username 'yahoo_hi' and ip address of 192.168.18.132 to use MetaGoofil.
In the sccanning process, I found the server is running SSH on port 22.

Based on these information, I can do password crack to type these exmple command

# medusa -h 192.168.18.132 -u yahoo_hi -P /usr/share/john/password.lst -M ssh
